# Description of the Projects
- **Project 1: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster**
    +  The project aims to utilize passenger data, including variables such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and more from the Titanic disaster to create a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of survival for passengers based on the provided features.

- **Project 2: Biomechanical Features of Orthopedic Patients**
    +  In this project, we build a machine learning model based on the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm  with data of biomechanical features of orthopedic patients in order to classify patients as belonging to        one out of three categories: Normal (100 patients), Disk Hernia (60 patients) or Spondylolisthesis (150 patients).
