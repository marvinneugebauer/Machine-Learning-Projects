# Description of the Projects
- **Project 1: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster**
    +  The project aims to utilize passenger data, including variables such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and more from the Titanic disaster to create a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of survival for passengers based on the provided features.

- **Project 2: Biomechanical Features of Orthopedic Patients**
    +  In this project, we build a machine learning model based on the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm  with data of biomechanical features of orthopedic patients in order to classify patients as belonging to        one out of three categories: Normal (100 patients), Disk Hernia (60 patients) or Spondylolisthesis (150 patients).
      
- **Project 3: Weather Conditions in World War Two**
    +  In this project we are investigating the relationship between the minimum and maximum temperatures and utilizing a linear regression model for temperature prediction. Therefore, we use data from the "Weather Conditions in World War Two" dataset.
      
- **Project 4: A/B-Testing**
    +  Given data that contains the advertisement click rate for two products, in this project we want to determine which product performs better. In order to achieve this goal, we use an A/B-Test.
