# Description of the Projects

- **Project 2: Biomechanical Features of Orthopedic Patients**
    +  In this project, we build a machine learning model based on the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm  with data of biomechanical features of orthopedic patients in order to classify patients as belonging to        one out of three categories: Normal (100 patients), Disk Hernia (60 patients) or Spondylolisthesis (150 patients).
